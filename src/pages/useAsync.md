It's generally a good practice to indicate to users the status of any async request. An example would be fetching data from an API and displaying a loading indicator before rendering the results. Another example would be a form where you want to disable the submit button when the submission is pending and then display either a success or error message when it completes.
<br/><br/>
Rather than litter your components with a bunch of `useState` calls to keep track of the state of an async function, you can use our custom hook which takes an async function as an input and returns the `pending`, `initial`, `value`, and `error` values we need to properly update our UI. As you'll see in the code below, our hook allows both immediate execution and delayed execution using the returned `execute` function.
