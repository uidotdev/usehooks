    name: useEffect custom comparator

This hook gives us the memoized value of an object, but instead of passing an array of dependencies (like with [useMemo](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)) we pass a custom compare function that gets both the previous and new value. The compare function can then compare nested properties, call object methods, or whatever else you need to do in order to determine equality. If the compare function returns true then the hook returns the old object reference.
<br/><br/>
Most of the time this hook shouldn't be necessary. Where it really comes in handy is if you want to offer a library to other developers and it would be awkward to force them to always memoize a value before passing it to your library. Read through the recipe and inline comments below to get a better sense of how this all works. While this example is fairly abstract, I'll be posting a new recipe soon that would have been really difficult to build without using this internally. Be sure to subscribe above if you don't want to miss it ;)
