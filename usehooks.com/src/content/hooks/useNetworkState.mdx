<HookDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  The useNetworkState React hook delivers real-time insights about the network
  status in your application, helping to adapt app behavior to varying
  connectivity conditions. It offers up-to-date snapshots of the network state,
  such as online/offline status, connection speed, and type. Through its use,
  you can respond effectively to network changes, fostering a seamless user
  experience even under unstable or varying connectivity. Please note, this hook
  is intended for client-side use only.
