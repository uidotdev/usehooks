<HookDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  The useMeasure hook provides a convenient and efficient way to monitor and
  respond to changes in the size of a React component. This custom hook uses the
  ResizeObserver API to actively track changes in the component's dimensions,
  such as width and height, and keeps them available as state. The returned ref
  is used on the element whose dimensions you want to measure, making it a
  valuable tool for responsive design and dynamic layout adjustments.
