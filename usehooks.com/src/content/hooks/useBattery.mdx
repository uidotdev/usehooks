<HookDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  The useBattery hook is useful for accessing and monitoring the battery status
  of the user's device in a React application. By using this hook, you can
  easily retrieve information such as the battery level, charging status, and
  estimated charging and discharging times. It provides a state object that
  includes properties like supported, loading, level, charging, chargingTime,
  and dischargingTime.
